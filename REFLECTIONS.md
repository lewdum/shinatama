## History

Back in 2014, I was an... "eager" kid. I couldn't understand why things were the
way they were, but I also had no skill whatsoever to develop something like
this. I also wasn't that good at English. Ironically, now that I do have *some*
skill, I can see why nobody bothers with stuff like this lol

Oni and its community filled a special place in my life during those times and,
although I don't play it much anymore, nor interact much with the community that
remains from those days, I will never forget either of them. I've now replayed
the game from start to finish and it's crazy how well it holds up.

This will likely be my last Oni-related project, if I'm honest. Maybe it helps
a few people, maybe it doesn't help anybody at all, but I'm happy with it
regardless. In fact, I must be *really* happy, because I've rewritten it from
scratch like 5 times now. Or maybe I really *hate* it instead? lol
